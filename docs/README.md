Monday combines the efficiency of CLI commands with the user-friendliness of a graphical chatbot interface, making task management simple and intuitive.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Java 17 or higher
- Gradle (included via wrapper)

### Installation & Running

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd monday
   ```

2. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew run
   ```

4. **Create standalone JAR (optional)**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew shadowJar
   java -jar build/libs/MONDAY.jar
   ```

## Core Features

### **Adding Todo Tasks**
Create simple tasks without time constraints using the chatbot interface.

Example: `todo read Java textbook`

```
Got it. I've added this task:
  [T][ ] read Java textbook
Now you have 1 tasks in the list.
```

### **Adding Deadlines**
Add tasks with specific due dates and times. The chatbot understands natural deadline expressions.

Example: `deadline submit assignment /by 2024-12-31 2359`

```
Got it. I've added this task:
  [D][ ] submit assignment (by: Dec 31 2024, 11:59 PM)
Now you have 2 tasks in the list.
```

### **Adding Events**
Schedule tasks with start and end times for proper time management.

Example: `event team meeting /from 2024-12-25 1400 /to 2024-12-25 1600`

```
Got it. I've added this task:
  [E][ ] team meeting (from: Dec 25 2024, 2:00 PM to: Dec 25 2024, 4:00 PM)
Now you have 3 tasks in the list.
```

### **Task Management**
Mark tasks as complete, unmark them, or delete tasks entirely through simple commands.

Examples: 
- `mark 1` - Mark first task as completed
- `unmark 2` - Mark second task as incomplete  
- `delete 3` - Remove third task from list

```
Nice! I've marked this task as done:
  [T][X] read Java textbook
```

### **Smart Search**
Find tasks quickly using keyword search across all task descriptions.

Example: `find assignment`

```
Here are the matching tasks in your list:
2.[D][ ] submit assignment (by: Dec 31 2024, 11:59 PM)
```

### **Task Listing**
View all your tasks in an organized format showing type, completion status, and details.

Example: `list`

```
Here are the tasks in your list:
1.[T][X] read Java textbook
2.[D][ ] submit assignment (by: Dec 31 2024, 11:59 PM)
3.[E][ ] team meeting (from: Dec 25 2024, 2:00 PM to: Dec 25 2024, 4:00 PM)
```

### **Priority Support**
Assign priority levels to tasks for better organization and focus.

Example: `todo important task /priority high`

### **Persistent Storage**
All tasks are automatically saved to `./data/monday.txt` and restored when you restart the application.

### **Dual Interface**
Choose between command-line interface for power users or JavaFX GUI for a modern chatbot experience.

### **Help System**
Get assistance anytime with the built-in help command.

Example: `help`

```
Available commands:
- todo <description> - Add a simple task
- deadline <description> /by <date time> - Add task with deadline
- event <description> /from <start> /to <end> - Add event with time range
- list - Show all tasks
- mark <number> - Mark task as completed
- unmark <number> - Mark task as incomplete
- delete <number> - Remove a task
- find <keyword> - Search tasks
- bye - Exit the application
```
